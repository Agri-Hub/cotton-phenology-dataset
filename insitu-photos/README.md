## Photos from in-situ visits
The folder contains a small sample and in the [link]() one can find all the photos from in-situ visits. 
A  panoramic  photo  of  the  field, and two-three  close-up  photos  of  representative  plants  for  the `main` and `secondary` phenological stages.
They can be retrieved by photo's name. Specifically, each photo is named in the following form `Date_id-{O,A,B}.jpg` where `date = date of visit`, `id = the unqiue identifier of parcel in 4 digits e.g 0073` and one of three letters `{O,A,B}` where `O = overall`, `A = main stage` and `B = secondary stage` .
