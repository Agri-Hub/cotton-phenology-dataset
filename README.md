# Cotton Phenology Dataset :seedling:

The dataset contains labels about the phenological stages of cotton at the parcel level, generated by in-situ inspections in the region of Orchomenos, Greece, during the cotton cultivation period of 2021 (May-October). We collected 1,285 crop growth ground observations. We introduce a new collection protocol, assigning up to two phenology labels that represent the primary and secondary growth stage in the field and thus indicate when stages are transitioning. More information about the annotation procedure can be found in the relevant publication ["Fuzzy clustering for the within-season estimation of cotton phenology"](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282364#). 

Along with the annotations we are publishing a unique dataset of 3,142 images. Each image is named in the following format:

`{date}_{id}-{type}.jpg`, where `date` is in the format `{year}{month}{day}` and refes to the exact date that the image was captured, `id` is the unique id of a parcel and `type` is one of `O, A or B`. `O` refers to a panoramic photo of the entire field, `A` to a photo that is representative of the majority of the plants in the field and `B` to one representative of a minority of plants in the field. For each date and each unique parcel the first two exists always while the latter close-up photo had be captured only when the percentage of the minority class, in terms of area, was deemed significant.

## Downloading the phenology dataset through direct links
To download the data, you can use the following links, taken from [the corresponding page of the dataset on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7646864):
* Phenology ground observations [(download link)](https://zenodo.org/record/7646864/files/in_situ_cotton_phenology_labels.csv?download=1)
* Parcels' geometries [(download link)](https://zenodo.org/record/7646864/files/parcels.geojson?download=1)
* Field images [(download link)](https://zenodo.org/record/7646864/files/cotton_phenology_in-situ_photos_2021.zip?download=1)

<br/><br/>


## Downloading phenology dataset through the provided download script
An alternative way to download the dataset, is to use the `download.sh` script included in this repository. The instructions for the script usage are as follows:

1. download the .csv with the ground observations and the corresponing geojson file of the parcels' geometries to `data/`
```bash
bash download.sh phenology
```
2. download field images to `data/images` (~ 12.3GB)
  ```bash
  bash download.sh images
  ````
or download everything with `bash download.sh all`
<br/><br/>

There are available: 
- a geojson file, which contains the polygons of 80 parcels coupled with an id. 

### 1286 Unique Visits in 80 Parcels 
![parcels](/images/parcels.png)

- a csv file, which includes: 
  - the main and secondary (if exist) phenological stage and its percentage per in-situ visit in parcel level.
  - the metalabel per in-situ visit (as they are described in the paper).
  - each visit is assigned to the nearest sentinel-2 acquistion or acquistions.

### Overall Statistics

| Phenological stage | # Main | # Secondary | Code[^1] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Root Establishment` | 75 | 4 | 1 |
| `Leaf Development` | 422 | 20 | 2 |
| `Squaring` | 212 | 6 | 3 |
| `Flowering` | 229 | 149 | 4 |
| `Boll Development` | 251 | 313 | 5 |
| `Boll Opening` | 97 | 177 | 6 |
| **`Total`**[^2]  | **1286** | **668** | - |

The  field  visits  were  appropriately  scheduled  in  order  to have  minimal  differences  between  ground  and  satellite  observations.  Thus, difference between  the  ground  and  the Sentinel-2 observation was `mean = 0.67 days` with `standard deviation = 0.58 days` .

*(they will be public available after the paper publication)*

### Photos
[Here]() one can find all the photos from in-situ visits.

*(they will be public available after the paper publication)* 

They can be retrieved by photo's name. Specifically, each photo is named in the following form `Date_id-{O,A,B}.jpg` where `date = date of visit`, `id = the unqiue identifier of parcel in 4 digits e.g 0073` and one of three letters `{O,A,B}` where `O = overall`, `A = main stage` and `B = secondary stage` .
