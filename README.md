# Cotton Phenology Dataset :seedling:
Labeled dataset regarding transition of phenological stages of cotton at the parcel level. Generated by in-situ inspections in the region of Orchomenos-GR at the cotton cultivation period of 2021.

There are available: 
- a geojson file, which contains the polygons of 80 parcels coupled with an id. 

### 1286 Unique Visits in 80 Parcels 
![parcels](/images/parcels.png)

- a csv file, which includes: 
  - the main and secondary (if exist) phenological stage and its percentage per in-situ visit in parcel level.
  - the metalabel per in-situ visit (as they are described in the paper).
  - each visit is assigned to the nearest sentinel-2 acquistion or acquistions.

### Overall Statistics

| Phenological stage | # Main | # Secondary | Code[^1] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Root Establishment` | 75 | 4 | 1 |
| `Leaf Development` | 422 | 20 | 2 |
| `Squaring` | 212 | 6 | 3 |
| `Flowering` | 229 | 149 | 4 |
| `Boll Development` | 251 | 313 | 5 |
| `Boll Opening` | 97 | 177 | 6 |
| **`Total`**[^2]  | **1286** | **668** | - |

The  field  visits  were  appropriately  scheduled  in  order  to have  minimal  differences  between  ground  and  satellite  observations.  Thus, difference between  the  ground  and  the Sentinel-2 observation was `mean = 0.67 days` with `standard deviation = 0.58 days` .

*(they will be public available after the paper publication)*

### Photos
[Here]() one can find all the photos from in-situ visits.

*(they will be public available after the paper publication)* 

They can be retrieved by photo's name. Specifically, each photo is named in the following form `Date_id-{O,A,B}.jpg` where `date = date of visit`, `id = the unqiue identifier of parcel in 4 digits e.g 0073` and one of three letters `{O,A,B}` where `O = overall`, `A = main stage` and `B = secondary stage` .
