# Cotton Phenology Dataset :seedling:
Labeled dataset regarding transition of phenological stages of cotton at the parcel level. Generated by in-situ inspections in the region of Orchomenos-GR at the cotton cultivation period of 2021.

## Downloading the phenology dataset through direct links
To download the data, you can use the following links, taken from [the corresponding page of the dataset on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7646864):
* Phenology ground observations [(download link)](https://zenodo.org/record/7646864/files/in_situ_cotton_phenology_labels.csv?download=1)
* Parcels' geometries [(download link)](https://zenodo.org/record/7646864/files/parcels.geojson?download=1)
* Field images [(download link)](https://zenodo.org/record/7646864/files/cotton_phenology_in-situ_photos_2021.zip?download=1)
  * _file size: ~12.3GB
<br/><br/>


## Downloading phenology dataset through the provided download script
An alternative way to download the dataset, is to use the `download.sh` script included in this repository. The instructions for the script usage are as follows:

1. download the .csv with the ground observations and the corresponing geojson file of the parcels' geometries to `data/`
```bash
bash download.sh phenology
```
2. download field images to `data/images` (~ 12.3GB)
  ```bash
  bash download.sh images
  ````
or download everything with `bash download.sh all`
<br/><br/>

There are available: 
- a geojson file, which contains the polygons of 80 parcels coupled with an id. 

### 1286 Unique Visits in 80 Parcels 
![parcels](/images/parcels.png)

- a csv file, which includes: 
  - the main and secondary (if exist) phenological stage and its percentage per in-situ visit in parcel level.
  - the metalabel per in-situ visit (as they are described in the paper).
  - each visit is assigned to the nearest sentinel-2 acquistion or acquistions.

### Overall Statistics

| Phenological stage | # Main | # Secondary | Code[^1] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Root Establishment` | 75 | 4 | 1 |
| `Leaf Development` | 422 | 20 | 2 |
| `Squaring` | 212 | 6 | 3 |
| `Flowering` | 229 | 149 | 4 |
| `Boll Development` | 251 | 313 | 5 |
| `Boll Opening` | 97 | 177 | 6 |
| **`Total`**[^2]  | **1286** | **668** | - |

The  field  visits  were  appropriately  scheduled  in  order  to have  minimal  differences  between  ground  and  satellite  observations.  Thus, difference between  the  ground  and  the Sentinel-2 observation was `mean = 0.67 days` with `standard deviation = 0.58 days` .

*(they will be public available after the paper publication)*

### Photos
[Here]() one can find all the photos from in-situ visits.

*(they will be public available after the paper publication)* 

They can be retrieved by photo's name. Specifically, each photo is named in the following form `Date_id-{O,A,B}.jpg` where `date = date of visit`, `id = the unqiue identifier of parcel in 4 digits e.g 0073` and one of three letters `{O,A,B}` where `O = overall`, `A = main stage` and `B = secondary stage` .
