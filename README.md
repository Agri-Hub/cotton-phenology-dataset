# Cotton Phenlogy Dataset :seedling:
Labeled dataset regarding transition of phenological stages of cotton in parcel level.Generated by in situ inspections in the region of Orchomenos-GR at the cotton cultivation period of 2021.

There are available 
- a geojson file, which contains the polygons of 80 parcels coupled with an id. 

### 1286 Unique Visits in 80 Parcels 
![parcels](/images/parcels.png)

- a csv file, which includes: 
  - the main and secondary (if exist) phenological stage and its percentage per in-situ visit in parcel level.
  - the metalabel per in-situ visit (as they are described in the paper).
  - each visit is assigned to the nearest sentinel-2 acquistion or acquistions.
